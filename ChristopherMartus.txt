Hi, my name is Christopher. I have been going to Washtenaw Community college for Almost 4 years now because I did some classes while I was in high school. This will be one of my last semesters at Washtenaw. I am part of a 3 in 1 program with Eastern for computer science with java. I will be going to Eastern in the fall to complete my degree. I like to play sports, workout, play video games and making things.
