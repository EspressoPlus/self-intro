Howdy! I'm Clayton Kingdon and I'm a part-time student in the Web Database Programming Professional certificate program at WCC. This class, CPS 298, is the last one required for the certificate. Prior to this, starting in Winter 2021, I've taken CPS161 Java/Intro Programming, CPS251 Android/Kotlin, CPS276 PHP/MySQL, CPS278 Java Server Programming, and CIS282 Database Programming.

Long long ago when I was a geologist I became interested in applications of geospatial technologies. Specifically, I used GIS and aerial imagery to look for diamonds, gold, and other heavy minerals. I quickly moved away from geology but I continued to use geospatial tools for forest and agro-ecology research. For 20 years I've worked in various capacities in university research labs, including project management, programming, sysadmin/IT, building custom instrumentation and hardware, writing/editing manuscripts and research proposals, grants administation, etc. In 2018 I decided to take a break from all of that, reset, and try some new things. 

Regarding my programming background, I'm pretty comfortable in the following languages and environments: 
* Python
* Java/Eclipse
* Bash/Linux (Debian, RHEL)
* Kotlin/Android Studio
* MySQL
* Azure Data Studio
* R/RStudio
* PHP
* HTML
* open source geospatial tech for data processing

I also have a little experience (recently and/or long ago) with:
* PERL
* Fortran
* SAS
* GEE
* C
* IDL
* Matlab
 
Here's my **[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonkingdon/)**. I'm not super active there, but feel free to connect.

And, if you're curious, here's a list of **[publications](https://tinyurl.com/CK-google-scholar)** that I co-authored.

On the non-professional side, my wife and I like to hike and bike around south-east Michigan and go canoe camping when we get the chance. I'm a life-long hockey player and fan, and I volunteer at the local **[bike co-op](https://commoncycle.org/)** where I help people learn how to fix their own bikes.
