Hello. I’m David Ager and I’m here at WCC pursuing a java programing certificate. I have completed the intro/advanced java class’s, android programing kotlin class and the intro to python class. I have really enjoyed them all so far. This class is my last one to complete the certificate. 
I have a bachelor's degree in chemistry and work full time as a research technician at BASF. I’m hoping to eventually start a career in the tech field and hoping that this java certificate will eb a good start. In my free time I enjoy hiking, video games, brewing beer and traveling. Looking forward working with this group!
