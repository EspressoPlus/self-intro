Hello! I’m Annabelle Kesterson, my friends and family call me Belle or Bella for short. I’m a part-time student at WCC and at Southern New Hampshire University. I’m getting my Associates in Computer Science and my Bachelors in Graphic Design and Media Art. Ill be graduating from WCC this May. In 2020 I built my first computer which started a passion for my degree now. The languages I'm familiar with is Python, C++, Java, PHP and HTML, and a couple SQL softwares like Oracle and MySQL Workbench. Starting at the end of February I will be learning Adobe. 
A couple things about me other than school: I live in Canton with my significant other of 5 years; whom works for Ford, and my two cats Simba and Appa. Half of my family lives in Jackson City and the other half lives in Rincon Puerto Rico. I take a trip or two out to PR every year.
I come from a Hippie family that travels often and makes a living from blockchain, so I have plenty of stories if you’re curious. Hobbies we like to do here in Michigan: gaming, camping, boating, and geocaching!
I’m very excited to be working with Y’all! I am open to criticism on my work, as I will try to incorporate everyone’s ideas into my programming, so please feel free to give me your input!
